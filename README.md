# Description
A personal tutorial repository to pratice git commands. This started out as a local repository stored on my personal computer.
# Contents
  - `index.html:` a html file

  - `notes.txt:` contains notes on git commands

  - `README.txt:` A README.md is a text file, usually written in Markdown, that provides information about a project. It’s one of the first things people see when they visit a repository
    (like on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Think of it as the project’s "cover page" or "manual."

    More information about markdown can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/
# I made changes:
Directly on GitHub: run `git pull` to update your local repository

On my local machine: run `git push origin` to update the remote repository

YOU MUST RUN THESE COMMANDS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY THAT THE REPOSITORY IS IN!!!
