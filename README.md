# Description
A personal tutorial repository (aka repo) to pratice git commands.

But I might as well us this repo to pratice front-end development...

This started out as a local repository stored on my personal computer.
# Contents
  - `index.html:` a html file

  - `notes.txt:` contains notes on git commands

  - `README.md:` A README.md is a text file, usually written in Markdown (.md), that provides information about a project. It’s one of the first things people see when they visit a repository
    (like on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Think of it as the project’s "cover page" or "manual."

    More information about markdown can be found here: https://www.markdownguide.org/

    Practice writing .md files with an online editor: https://dillinger.io/
# I made changes:
Directly on GitHub: I run `git pull` to update my local repository (the one on my personal computer) 

On my local machine: run `git push origin` to update the remote repository (this GitHub repository!)

**YOU MUST RUN THESE COMMANDS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY THAT THE REPOSITORY IS IN!!!**

# Be on the lookout for...
I may practice GitHub branches...

I may add some CSS and JavaScript...
